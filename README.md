# Cashier-application
used C# and Windows Forms to build a cashier application

run "saleh store.exe"

this application was for a project in one of my university courses , i learned C# and wrote this code application in under a day and a half ,even though the code is really bad and needs a lof of refactoring i'm pretty happy with the results considering the short learning window
